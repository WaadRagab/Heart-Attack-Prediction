# Heart Attack Analysis and Prediction using LDA, PSO, and Machine Learning
## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart attacks using various machine learning techniques. We leverage Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for dimensionality reduction, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection, and multiple classifiers including Logistic Regression and Random Forest to achieve high prediction accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset from Kaggle. The dataset consists of various medical attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and other relevant features that can help in predicting heart attacks.

## Methodology
#### Data Preprocessing
Shuffling and Splitting: The dataset is shuffled to ensure random distribution of samples and split into features (data) and target (output).
Scaling: StandardScaler is used to normalize the feature data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

#### Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
LDA is used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, retaining the most significant features that contribute to class separability. This helps in improving the performance of classifiers by reducing overfitting.

#### Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
PSO is implemented to select the most relevant features from the reduced dataset. It is an optimization technique inspired by the social behavior of birds and fishes, which helps in selecting the best features by iteratively improving candidate solutions with respect to a given measure of quality.

## Model Training and Evaluation
Two classifiers are trained and evaluated on the selected features:
1. Logistic Regression: Implemented from scratch to understand the inner workings and performance.
2. Random Forest Classifier: A powerful ensemble method used for classification.
   
Both models are evaluated using accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and detailed classification reports to assess their performance.

## Results
1. Logistic Regression: Achieved a competitive accuracy with selected features. Provided insights through detailed confusion matrix and classification report.
2. Random Forest Classifier: Demonstrated high accuracy and robustness in predicting heart attack likelihood.
   
## Visualizations
Label Frequency Distribution: A bar chart visualizing the distribution of target labels.
Confusion Matrix: A heatmap to illustrate the performance of the classifiers in terms of true and predicted labels.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of feature selection and dimensionality reduction in improving the performance of machine learning models. By integrating LDA and PSO with standard classifiers, we achieve reliable predictions for heart attack analysis.
